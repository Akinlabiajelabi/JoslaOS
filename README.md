# JoslaOS

## Prompt
Develop an electric power utility platform-as-a-service using Smart Grid technologies and applications. On one hand, the platform should integrate seamlessly with proprietary microelectro mechanical systems (MEMS) that captures key parameters within an electric power utility. On the other hand, the platform should enable proprietary and third party applications access data through secure connection and authentication.

## Background
Nigeria's electricity market has seen considerable change over the last decades. The transition from a government-owned monopolitic market to one that thrives on competition started with the passing of the electricity reform act of 2005. The power market was eventually unbundled in 2014 into 21 successor companies consisting of 9 Generation, 1 Transmission and 11 Distribution Companies. Moving forward, these utilities need to gain a competitive advantage to ensure that their electric network is efficient, reliable and sustainable.

The concept of smart grid currently being implemented in [Europe](#), [USA](#), [China](#) and [India](#) involves the integration of information and communication technologies between any points in electricity supply and consumption. This will enable the grid (network of electrical systems with fundamental function to connect electric energy suppliers and consumers in real time) become more observable, controlled, automated and interoperable with various renewable energy sources.

While Nigeria with a population of over 180m has only about 50% electrification and rely mostly on thermal generation accounting for over 90% of its total generation. The shift to ensure that the national gird is smart will greatly drive the much needed economic development across the nation. It will provide improved life expectance on the existing  aged transmission and distribution network and provide more people with access through remote integration of microgrids powered by renewable energy technologies.

## Value Proposition
JoslaOS is a platform-as-a-service application that combines [data mining](#), [cloud computing](#) and [dynamic web application](#) to optimise the operations of an electric power utility. The platform offers various stakeholders - financiers, managers, engineers and technicians - self-service access through web and mobile for collaborative analytics and insight. The features of the platform includes;

- Load forecasting
- Real-time network status visualisation
- Text streaming for reporting
- On-demand educational resources

The fundamental design principle of JoslaOS is to improve electric system efficiency and engineering service reliability. On one hand, the systems are retofiited with MEMS that can capture and remotely communicate key operation data over the internet to provide real-time information on the platform that mitigate system downtime. On the other hand, faults occurence trigger events, notifications and alarms that provide standard procedures for location, isolation and restoration proceses that reduce response time for engineers and technicians.

## Technology Review
JoslaOS uses state-of-the-art data mining algorithms developed in R, made interactive using dynamic web applications and deployed on Amazon Web Services. Therefore the platform uses a three tier system -application, model and database- securely connected using virtual private network in the cloud.

Data mining algorithms are used to process data into information, information into insight used to guide decisions to solve operation challenges. These algorithms are developed as proprietary resources for Josla and include nearest neighbour, regression, neural network, fuzzy logic and support vector machine. Dynamic web application are used for server-side web development that builds on static web development using HTML & CSS. Amazon web service is a secure cloud service platform that provides on-demand computing resources to support business operations.
